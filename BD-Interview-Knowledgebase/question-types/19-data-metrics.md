## Example Answers

- I use a metric stack: activity quality, stage conversion, sales velocity, and revenue outcomes.
- When performance drops, I isolate where conversion breaks and test one variable at a time.
- I prioritize metrics tied directly to business outcomes, not just high activity counts.

## Real Business Scenarios

- A BD team shifted from call volume targets to qualified meeting rate and increased pipeline quality significantly.
- Win/loss pattern analysis revealed repeated losses in one vertical due to integration gaps.

## Best Practices

- Use a clear structure: context, action, outcome, learning.
- Quantify impact with metrics such as conversion rate, revenue, cycle time, or retention.
- Show buyer empathy and business understanding, not just sales tactics.
- Tie your answer to role expectations and company stage.
- Keep responses concise, then expand if asked.

## Mistakes to Avoid

- Giving generic answers without numbers.
- Over-focusing on activity volume instead of business outcomes.
- Criticizing past teams or customers.
- Ignoring cross-functional alignment with marketing, product, and customer success.
- Not asking clarifying questions in scenario prompts.
