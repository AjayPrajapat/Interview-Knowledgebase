## Example Answers

- I hit targets through disciplined pipeline coverage, stage hygiene, and daily high-value activity blocks.
- If behind plan, I diagnose by stage and focus on highest-leverage actions rather than increasing random activity.
- I communicate risk early and propose mitigation plans with measurable checkpoints.

## Real Business Scenarios

- A BD manager recovered a weak quarter by reallocating effort to high-conversion segments and tightening deal review cadence.
- A rep improved consistency after adopting stage-based weekly planning.

## Best Practices

- Use a clear structure: context, action, outcome, learning.
- Quantify impact with metrics such as conversion rate, revenue, cycle time, or retention.
- Show buyer empathy and business understanding, not just sales tactics.
- Tie your answer to role expectations and company stage.
- Keep responses concise, then expand if asked.

## Mistakes to Avoid

- Giving generic answers without numbers.
- Over-focusing on activity volume instead of business outcomes.
- Criticizing past teams or customers.
- Ignoring cross-functional alignment with marketing, product, and customer success.
- Not asking clarifying questions in scenario prompts.
