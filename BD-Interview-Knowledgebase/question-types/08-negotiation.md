## Example Answers

- I negotiate by linking concessions to reciprocal commitments, such as term length, scope clarity, or payment terms.
- I avoid immediate discounting and instead reinforce value through quantified impact and implementation certainty.
- If economics or strategic fit are misaligned, I prefer a disciplined no-deal over a low-quality close.

## Real Business Scenarios

- A vendor maintained pricing by offering phased onboarding and executive QBRs instead of discounting.
- A startup won a competitive deal by trading invoice terms for longer contract duration.

## Best Practices

- Use a clear structure: context, action, outcome, learning.
- Quantify impact with metrics such as conversion rate, revenue, cycle time, or retention.
- Show buyer empathy and business understanding, not just sales tactics.
- Tie your answer to role expectations and company stage.
- Keep responses concise, then expand if asked.

## Mistakes to Avoid

- Giving generic answers without numbers.
- Over-focusing on activity volume instead of business outcomes.
- Criticizing past teams or customers.
- Ignoring cross-functional alignment with marketing, product, and customer success.
- Not asking clarifying questions in scenario prompts.
