## Example Answers

- I start with objective and baseline metrics, then identify the largest performance gap and likely causes.
- Recommendations should include expected impact, execution risk, and required cross-functional support.

## Real Business Scenarios

- Ignoring cross-functional alignment with marketing, product, and customer success.
- Not asking clarifying questions in scenario prompts.
