# Role Understanding

## Overview

This category evaluates how well candidates understand the specific BD role, territory, target segment, and cross-functional responsibilities in the hiring company.

## Why Interviewers Ask This

Interviewers want to confirm role fit, ownership clarity, and whether the candidate understands practical execution in the target market.

## Key Concepts

- Territory and segment ownership
- Inbound vs outbound motion
- Handoff model with AEs/CS
- Role goals by quarter
- Stakeholder collaboration

## Common Interview Questions

1. Why are you interested in this BD role?
2. What do you think success in this role looks like in 90 days?
3. How would you learn our product quickly?
4. How do you partner with account executives?
5. How would you approach this territory?
6. What risks do you see in this market?
7. How do you prioritize verticals?
8. What questions would you ask your manager in week one?
9. How do you align with marketing and product teams?
10. How do you adapt if role expectations change?

## Example Answers

- In the first 90 days, I would map ICP, understand win/loss patterns, and build a repeatable outreach playbook for top segments.
- I see this role as pipeline ownership plus strategic market feedback to improve messaging and product fit.
- I collaborate with AEs on account strategy and with marketing on campaign-level experimentation.

## Real Business Scenarios

- A new BD hire inherited an undefined territory; creating account tiers and weekly AE syncs increased meeting-to-opportunity rate by 20%.
- In a startup, role scope expanded into partnerships; early role clarification prevented duplicated outreach.

## Best Practices

- Use a clear structure: context, action, outcome, learning.
- Quantify impact with metrics such as conversion rate, revenue, cycle time, or retention.
- Show buyer empathy and business understanding, not just sales tactics.
- Tie your answer to role expectations and company stage.
- Keep responses concise, then expand if asked.

## Mistakes to Avoid

- Giving generic answers without numbers.
- Over-focusing on activity volume instead of business outcomes.
- Criticizing past teams or customers.
- Ignoring cross-functional alignment with marketing, product, and customer success.
- Not asking clarifying questions in scenario prompts.
