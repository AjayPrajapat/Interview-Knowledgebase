## Example Answers

- I treat objections as buying signals and first clarify whether the concern is economic, technical, or organizational.
- For price objections, I map cost to business outcome and offer scope options before discounts.
- I close objections with documented next steps and owner-level accountability.

## Real Business Scenarios

- A buyer concerned about migration risk agreed to proceed after a pilot with clear success criteria and rollback options.
- A price-sensitive account converted after value comparison against hidden operational costs.

## Best Practices

- Use a clear structure: context, action, outcome, learning.
- Quantify impact with metrics such as conversion rate, revenue, cycle time, or retention.
- Show buyer empathy and business understanding, not just sales tactics.
- Tie your answer to role expectations and company stage.
- Keep responses concise, then expand if asked.

## Mistakes to Avoid

- Giving generic answers without numbers.
- Over-focusing on activity volume instead of business outcomes.
- Criticizing past teams or customers.
- Ignoring cross-functional alignment with marketing, product, and customer success.
- Not asking clarifying questions in scenario prompts.
