## Example Answers

- I segment by ICP and intent signals before outreach, which improves response quality over pure volume.
- I score leads using firmographic fit, pain relevance, and engagement behavior, then route based on readiness.
- I run weekly experiments on subject lines, CTA style, and persona-specific proof points.

## Real Business Scenarios

- A fintech BD team combined intent data with referral outreach and doubled meetings per rep.
- A B2B startup reduced low-fit meetings by introducing a qualification form before demos.

## Best Practices

- Use a clear structure: context, action, outcome, learning.
- Quantify impact with metrics such as conversion rate, revenue, cycle time, or retention.
- Show buyer empathy and business understanding, not just sales tactics.
- Tie your answer to role expectations and company stage.
- Keep responses concise, then expand if asked.

## Mistakes to Avoid

- Giving generic answers without numbers.
- Over-focusing on activity volume instead of business outcomes.
- Criticizing past teams or customers.
- Ignoring cross-functional alignment with marketing, product, and customer success.
- Not asking clarifying questions in scenario prompts.
