## Example Answers

- BD is responsible for creating and progressing revenue opportunities through targeted prospecting, qualification, and stakeholder alignment.
- A qualified lead has clear pain, budget potential, authority path, and a realistic timeline.
- I track leading metrics (meetings booked, SQL rate) and lagging metrics (pipeline created, closed revenue) to manage performance.

## Real Business Scenarios

- A SaaS team had strong lead volume but weak conversion. Re-defining ICP and qualification criteria improved SQL-to-opportunity conversion by 28%.
- A services firm reduced sales cycle by pre-qualifying technical fit before discovery calls.

## Best Practices

- Use a clear structure: context, action, outcome, learning.
- Quantify impact with metrics such as conversion rate, revenue, cycle time, or retention.
- Show buyer empathy and business understanding, not just sales tactics.
- Tie your answer to role expectations and company stage.
- Keep responses concise, then expand if asked.

## Mistakes to Avoid

- Giving generic answers without numbers.
- Over-focusing on activity volume instead of business outcomes.
- Criticizing past teams or customers.
- Ignoring cross-functional alignment with marketing, product, and customer success.
- Not asking clarifying questions in scenario prompts.
