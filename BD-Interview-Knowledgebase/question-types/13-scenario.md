## Example Answers

- I would stabilize risk first, then execute high-impact actions with clear owners and timelines.
- In a stalled deal, I re-confirm business urgency, map blockers by stakeholder, and propose a close plan with explicit commitments.
- For sudden performance drops, I segment by channel/persona to isolate root causes before changing everything.

## Real Business Scenarios

- During quarter-end pressure, a team recovered pipeline by narrowing focus to high-probability opportunities and executive escalation.
- A champion departure was mitigated through stakeholder remapping and rapid value recap to new decision-makers.

## Best Practices

- Use a clear structure: context, action, outcome, learning.
- Quantify impact with metrics such as conversion rate, revenue, cycle time, or retention.
- Show buyer empathy and business understanding, not just sales tactics.
- Tie your answer to role expectations and company stage.
- Keep responses concise, then expand if asked.

## Mistakes to Avoid

- Giving generic answers without numbers.
- Over-focusing on activity volume instead of business outcomes.
- Criticizing past teams or customers.
- Ignoring cross-functional alignment with marketing, product, and customer success.
- Not asking clarifying questions in scenario prompts.
