## Example Answers

- My process uses clear stage definitions with measurable next steps, so pipeline quality remains high.
- I run discovery around pain, current process, impact, and buying process, then summarize mutual action plans.
- For stalled deals, I revisit business urgency, update stakeholders, and create a concrete close plan with dates.

## Real Business Scenarios

- A B2B software team reduced stage slippage by introducing mandatory next-step commitments in every customer call.
- A mid-market motion improved close rate after standardizing discovery notes and proposal templates.

## Best Practices

- Use a clear structure: context, action, outcome, learning.
- Quantify impact with metrics such as conversion rate, revenue, cycle time, or retention.
- Show buyer empathy and business understanding, not just sales tactics.
- Tie your answer to role expectations and company stage.
- Keep responses concise, then expand if asked.

## Mistakes to Avoid

- Giving generic answers without numbers.
- Over-focusing on activity volume instead of business outcomes.
- Criticizing past teams or customers.

- Not asking clarifying questions in scenario prompts.
