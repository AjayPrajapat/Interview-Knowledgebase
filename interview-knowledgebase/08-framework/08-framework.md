# Framework

## Overview

Framework questions assess how you use ecosystem tools effectively rather than memorizing APIs.

## Skills Evaluated

- Concept clarity and structured thinking
- Practical decision-making under constraints
- Communication quality for technical and business audiences
- Risk awareness and mitigation planning
- Measurable outcome orientation

## Typical Interview Questions

1. How do you choose a framework for a new project?
2. What tradeoffs matter when adopting a framework?
3. How do you structure a framework-based application?
4. How do you manage upgrades safely?
5. How do you enforce best practices in framework usage?
6. How do you handle framework performance bottlenecks?
7. How do you test framework-specific components?
8. How do you avoid framework lock-in risk?
9. How do you onboard teammates to a framework stack?
10. How do you decide when to use framework defaults vs custom logic?

## Example Answers / Key Points

- Start with a direct, role-relevant answer in one or two lines.
- Use concrete examples from projects, campaigns, deals, incidents, or launches.
- Quantify impact where possible (latency, conversion, win rate, revenue, retention, time saved).
- Mention tradeoffs and why your chosen approach fit the context.
- Close with a concise summary statement.

## Common Mistakes Candidates Make

- Giving abstract answers without context.
- Skipping constraints, assumptions, or risks.
- Answering only theory and not execution.
- Ignoring stakeholder impact (customers, team, business).
- Not providing measurable outcomes.

## Advanced Follow-up Questions

1. What would make you choose a different approach?
2. How would your answer change at 10x scale or in a regulated environment?
3. What metrics would you monitor post-implementation?
4. How would you explain this to a non-technical stakeholder?
5. What failure mode worries you most and why?

## Real-world Application

This question type appears in architecture reviews, sales strategy meetings, product planning, incident response, and leadership evaluations. Mastering it improves communication quality, decision speed, and delivery reliability.

## Recommended Answer Framework (Applied)

Use the 5-step model:
1. Definition
2. How it works
3. Simple example
4. Real-world use case
5. Summary line

## Question-by-Question Application

- For Question 1-3: give a one-line definition, then mechanism and an example.
- For Question 4-6: explain principle, then practical use in your work.
- For Question 7-10: connect concept to tradeoffs and business impact.
