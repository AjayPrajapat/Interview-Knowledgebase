# Code Review

## Overview

Code review questions assess quality judgment, collaboration style, and risk detection ability.

## Skills Evaluated

- Concept clarity and structured thinking
- Practical decision-making under constraints
- Communication quality for technical and business audiences
- Risk awareness and mitigation planning
- Measurable outcome orientation

## Typical Interview Questions

1. What do you prioritize first in code review?
2. How do you separate blocking vs non-blocking comments?
3. How do you review for security and reliability?
4. How do you review for maintainability and readability?
5. How do you handle disagreements in review feedback?
6. How do you speed up review cycles without reducing quality?
7. How do you avoid style-only noise?
8. How do you use tests in review decisions?
9. How do you coach junior contributors via review?
10. How do you define review standards as a team?

## Example Answers / Key Points

- Start with a direct, role-relevant answer in one or two lines.
- Use concrete examples from projects, campaigns, deals, incidents, or launches.
- Quantify impact where possible (latency, conversion, win rate, revenue, retention, time saved).
- Mention tradeoffs and why your chosen approach fit the context.
- Close with a concise summary statement.

## Common Mistakes Candidates Make

- Giving abstract answers without context.
- Skipping constraints, assumptions, or risks.
- Answering only theory and not execution.
- Ignoring stakeholder impact (customers, team, business).
- Not providing measurable outcomes.

## Advanced Follow-up Questions

1. What would make you choose a different approach?
2. How would your answer change at 10x scale or in a regulated environment?
3. What metrics would you monitor post-implementation?
4. How would you explain this to a non-technical stakeholder?
5. What failure mode worries you most and why?

## Real-world Application

This question type appears in architecture reviews, sales strategy meetings, product planning, incident response, and leadership evaluations. Mastering it improves communication quality, decision speed, and delivery reliability.

## Recommended Answer Framework (Applied)

Use the 6-step model:
1. Clarify requirements and constraints
2. High-level approach
3. Step-by-step implementation
4. Risks and edge cases
5. Validation (tests/metrics/monitoring)
6. Summary with tradeoff statement

## Question-by-Question Application

- For Question 1-3: start with assumptions and system boundaries.
- For Question 4-7: provide phased implementation with dependencies.
- For Question 8-10: explain validation, rollout, and rollback plans.
