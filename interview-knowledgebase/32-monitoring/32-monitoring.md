# Monitoring

## Overview

Monitoring questions assess observability maturity and ability to detect and respond to real user impact.

## Skills Evaluated

- Concept clarity and structured thinking
- Practical decision-making under constraints
- Communication quality for technical and business audiences
- Risk awareness and mitigation planning
- Measurable outcome orientation

## Typical Interview Questions

1. How do you define SLIs and SLOs?
2. How do you build actionable alerts?
3. How do you reduce alert fatigue?
4. How do logs, metrics, and traces complement each other?
5. How do you design dashboards for on-call teams?
6. How do you monitor distributed transactions?
7. How do you detect silent failures?
8. How do you instrument new features?
9. How do you tie monitoring to business KPIs?
10. How do you run post-incident monitoring improvements?

## Example Answers / Key Points

- Start with a direct, role-relevant answer in one or two lines.
- Use concrete examples from projects, campaigns, deals, incidents, or launches.
- Quantify impact where possible (latency, conversion, win rate, revenue, retention, time saved).
- Mention tradeoffs and why your chosen approach fit the context.
- Close with a concise summary statement.

## Common Mistakes Candidates Make

- Giving abstract answers without context.
- Skipping constraints, assumptions, or risks.
- Answering only theory and not execution.
- Ignoring stakeholder impact (customers, team, business).
- Not providing measurable outcomes.

## Advanced Follow-up Questions

1. What would make you choose a different approach?
2. How would your answer change at 10x scale or in a regulated environment?
3. What metrics would you monitor post-implementation?
4. How would you explain this to a non-technical stakeholder?
5. What failure mode worries you most and why?

## Real-world Application

This question type appears in architecture reviews, sales strategy meetings, product planning, incident response, and leadership evaluations. Mastering it improves communication quality, decision speed, and delivery reliability.

## Recommended Answer Framework (Applied)

Use the 6-step diagnostic model:
1. Scope and reproduce
2. Collect evidence
3. Form hypotheses
4. Confirm root cause
5. Fix + rollback strategy
6. Prevent recurrence

## Question-by-Question Application

- For Question 1-3: show how you isolate symptoms from causes.
- For Question 4-7: explain evidence collection and hypothesis testing.
- For Question 8-10: end with prevention controls and monitoring.
