# Infrastructure

## Overview

Infrastructure questions test reliability-focused platform design and lifecycle management.

## Skills Evaluated

- Concept clarity and structured thinking
- Practical decision-making under constraints
- Communication quality for technical and business audiences
- Risk awareness and mitigation planning
- Measurable outcome orientation

## Typical Interview Questions

1. How do you design infra for high availability?
2. How do you apply IaC principles effectively?
3. How do you manage drift and change control?
4. How do you architect network segmentation?
5. How do you plan capacity and redundancy?
6. How do you validate disaster recovery readiness?
7. How do you secure infrastructure access?
8. How do you standardize environments?
9. How do you manage infra costs over time?
10. How do you evolve infrastructure without downtime?

## Example Answers / Key Points

- Start with a direct, role-relevant answer in one or two lines.
- Use concrete examples from projects, campaigns, deals, incidents, or launches.
- Quantify impact where possible (latency, conversion, win rate, revenue, retention, time saved).
- Mention tradeoffs and why your chosen approach fit the context.
- Close with a concise summary statement.

## Common Mistakes Candidates Make

- Giving abstract answers without context.
- Skipping constraints, assumptions, or risks.
- Answering only theory and not execution.
- Ignoring stakeholder impact (customers, team, business).
- Not providing measurable outcomes.

## Advanced Follow-up Questions

1. What would make you choose a different approach?
2. How would your answer change at 10x scale or in a regulated environment?
3. What metrics would you monitor post-implementation?
4. How would you explain this to a non-technical stakeholder?
5. What failure mode worries you most and why?

## Real-world Application

This question type appears in architecture reviews, sales strategy meetings, product planning, incident response, and leadership evaluations. Mastering it improves communication quality, decision speed, and delivery reliability.

## Recommended Answer Framework (Applied)

Use the 6-step model:
1. Clarify requirements and constraints
2. High-level approach
3. Step-by-step implementation
4. Risks and edge cases
5. Validation (tests/metrics/monitoring)
6. Summary with tradeoff statement

## Question-by-Question Application

- For Question 1-3: start with assumptions and system boundaries.
- For Question 4-7: provide phased implementation with dependencies.
- For Question 8-10: explain validation, rollout, and rollback plans.
