# Scenario

## Overview

Scenario questions evaluate situational judgment under ambiguity, pressure, and competing constraints.

## Skills Evaluated

- Concept clarity and structured thinking
- Practical decision-making under constraints
- Communication quality for technical and business audiences
- Risk awareness and mitigation planning
- Measurable outcome orientation

## Typical Interview Questions

1. A critical release is failing near deadline. What do you do?
2. A key customer escalates severe dissatisfaction. How do you respond?
3. A major metric drops suddenly after launch. What is your plan?
4. Two teams disagree on implementation direction. How do you align them?
5. You inherit a failing project with low trust. What are your first steps?
6. You must choose between speed and quality this quarter. How do you decide?
7. A competitor launches a similar feature first. What do you do next?
8. Budget is cut mid-quarter. How do you reprioritize?
9. A high-value deal depends on an unfinished capability. How do you handle it?
10. An executive asks for a decision with incomplete data. How do you proceed?

## Example Answers / Key Points

- Start with a direct, role-relevant answer in one or two lines.
- Use concrete examples from projects, campaigns, deals, incidents, or launches.
- Quantify impact where possible (latency, conversion, win rate, revenue, retention, time saved).
- Mention tradeoffs and why your chosen approach fit the context.
- Close with a concise summary statement.

## Common Mistakes Candidates Make

- Giving abstract answers without context.
- Skipping constraints, assumptions, or risks.
- Answering only theory and not execution.
- Ignoring stakeholder impact (customers, team, business).
- Not providing measurable outcomes.

## Advanced Follow-up Questions

1. What would make you choose a different approach?
2. How would your answer change at 10x scale or in a regulated environment?
3. What metrics would you monitor post-implementation?
4. How would you explain this to a non-technical stakeholder?
5. What failure mode worries you most and why?

## Real-world Application

This question type appears in architecture reviews, sales strategy meetings, product planning, incident response, and leadership evaluations. Mastering it improves communication quality, decision speed, and delivery reliability.

## Recommended Answer Framework (Applied)
