# Debugging

## Overview

Debugging questions assess your investigative process and ability to move from symptom to fix.

## Skills Evaluated

- Concept clarity and structured thinking
- Practical decision-making under constraints
- Communication quality for technical and business audiences
- Risk awareness and mitigation planning
- Measurable outcome orientation

## Typical Interview Questions

1. How do you debug an intermittent production issue?
2. How do you isolate environment-specific failures?
3. How do you debug memory leaks?
4. How do you debug race conditions?
5. How do logs and traces guide your process?
6. How do you prioritize hypotheses?
7. How do you confirm the true fix?
8. How do you reduce time-to-resolution?
9. How do you collaborate in high-pressure debugging?
10. How do you prevent recurrence after fix?

## Example Answers / Key Points

- Start with a direct, role-relevant answer in one or two lines.
- Use concrete examples from projects, campaigns, deals, incidents, or launches.
- Quantify impact where possible (latency, conversion, win rate, revenue, retention, time saved).
- Mention tradeoffs and why your chosen approach fit the context.
- Close with a concise summary statement.

## Common Mistakes Candidates Make

- Giving abstract answers without context.
- Skipping constraints, assumptions, or risks.
- Answering only theory and not execution.
- Ignoring stakeholder impact (customers, team, business).
- Not providing measurable outcomes.

## Advanced Follow-up Questions

1. What would make you choose a different approach?
2. How would your answer change at 10x scale or in a regulated environment?
3. What metrics would you monitor post-implementation?
4. How would you explain this to a non-technical stakeholder?
5. What failure mode worries you most and why?

## Real-world Application

This question type appears in architecture reviews, sales strategy meetings, product planning, incident response, and leadership evaluations. Mastering it improves communication quality, decision speed, and delivery reliability.

## Recommended Answer Framework (Applied)

Use the 6-step diagnostic model:
1. Scope and reproduce
2. Collect evidence
3. Form hypotheses
4. Confirm root cause
5. Fix + rollback strategy
6. Prevent recurrence

## Question-by-Question Application

- For Question 1-3: show how you isolate symptoms from causes.
- For Question 4-7: explain evidence collection and hypothesis testing.
- For Question 8-10: end with prevention controls and monitoring.
