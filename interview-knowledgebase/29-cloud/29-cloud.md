# Cloud

## Overview

Cloud questions assess architecture choices on managed platforms with cost, resilience, and governance tradeoffs.

## Skills Evaluated

- Concept clarity and structured thinking
- Practical decision-making under constraints
- Communication quality for technical and business audiences
- Risk awareness and mitigation planning
- Measurable outcome orientation

## Typical Interview Questions

1. How do you select cloud services for a workload?
2. How do you design multi-region deployment?
3. How do you optimize cloud cost?
4. How do you enforce security and compliance in cloud?
5. How do you design disaster recovery?
6. How do you manage cloud networking boundaries?
7. How do you monitor cloud-native systems?
8. How do you handle vendor lock-in risk?
9. How do you choose serverless vs container-based deployment?
10. How do you set cloud governance guardrails?

## Example Answers / Key Points

- Start with a direct, role-relevant answer in one or two lines.
- Use concrete examples from projects, campaigns, deals, incidents, or launches.
- Quantify impact where possible (latency, conversion, win rate, revenue, retention, time saved).
- Mention tradeoffs and why your chosen approach fit the context.
- Close with a concise summary statement.

## Common Mistakes Candidates Make

- Giving abstract answers without context.
- Skipping constraints, assumptions, or risks.
- Answering only theory and not execution.
- Ignoring stakeholder impact (customers, team, business).
- Not providing measurable outcomes.

## Advanced Follow-up Questions

1. What would make you choose a different approach?
2. How would your answer change at 10x scale or in a regulated environment?
3. What metrics would you monitor post-implementation?
4. How would you explain this to a non-technical stakeholder?
5. What failure mode worries you most and why?

## Real-world Application

This question type appears in architecture reviews, sales strategy meetings, product planning, incident response, and leadership evaluations. Mastering it improves communication quality, decision speed, and delivery reliability.

## Recommended Answer Framework (Applied)

Use the 5-step comparison model:
1. Decision criteria
2. Option A pros/cons
3. Option B pros/cons
4. Recommendation for this context
5. Risks and reversal trigger

## Question-by-Question Application

- For Question 1-3: define criteria before evaluating options.
- For Question 4-7: compare alternatives by cost, risk, and maintainability.
- For Question 8-10: conclude with context-specific recommendation.
