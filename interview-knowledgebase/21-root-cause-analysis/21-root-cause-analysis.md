# Root Cause Analysis

## Overview

RCA questions test post-incident rigor, systemic thinking, and prevention planning.

## Skills Evaluated

- Concept clarity and structured thinking
- Practical decision-making under constraints
- Communication quality for technical and business audiences
- Risk awareness and mitigation planning
- Measurable outcome orientation

## Typical Interview Questions

1. How do you run a blameless RCA?
2. How do you build a factual incident timeline?
3. How do you distinguish trigger from root cause?
4. How do you identify contributing factors?
5. How do you define corrective actions?
6. How do you prioritize prevention work?
7. How do you measure RCA effectiveness?
8. How do you communicate RCA findings to leadership?
9. How do you avoid repeating similar incidents?
10. How do you improve on-call readiness from RCA learnings?

## Example Answers / Key Points

- Start with a direct, role-relevant answer in one or two lines.
- Use concrete examples from projects, campaigns, deals, incidents, or launches.
- Quantify impact where possible (latency, conversion, win rate, revenue, retention, time saved).
- Mention tradeoffs and why your chosen approach fit the context.
- Close with a concise summary statement.

## Common Mistakes Candidates Make

- Giving abstract answers without context.
- Skipping constraints, assumptions, or risks.
- Answering only theory and not execution.
- Ignoring stakeholder impact (customers, team, business).
- Not providing measurable outcomes.

## Advanced Follow-up Questions

1. What would make you choose a different approach?
2. How would your answer change at 10x scale or in a regulated environment?
3. What metrics would you monitor post-implementation?
4. How would you explain this to a non-technical stakeholder?
5. What failure mode worries you most and why?

## Real-world Application

This question type appears in architecture reviews, sales strategy meetings, product planning, incident response, and leadership evaluations. Mastering it improves communication quality, decision speed, and delivery reliability.

## Recommended Answer Framework (Applied)

Use the 6-step diagnostic model:
1. Scope and reproduce
2. Collect evidence
3. Form hypotheses
4. Confirm root cause
5. Fix + rollback strategy
6. Prevent recurrence

## Question-by-Question Application

- For Question 1-3: show how you isolate symptoms from causes.
- For Question 4-7: explain evidence collection and hypothesis testing.
- For Question 8-10: end with prevention controls and monitoring.
