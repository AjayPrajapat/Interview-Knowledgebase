# Architecture

## Overview

Architecture questions evaluate system decomposition, boundaries, and long-term maintainability choices.

## Skills Evaluated

- Concept clarity and structured thinking
- Practical decision-making under constraints
- Communication quality for technical and business audiences
- Risk awareness and mitigation planning
- Measurable outcome orientation

## Typical Interview Questions

1. How do you define architecture boundaries?
2. How do you choose between modular monolith and microservices?
3. How do you enforce separation of concerns?
4. How do you design for reliability and changeability?
5. How do you handle cross-cutting concerns?
6. How do you choose sync vs async communication?
7. How do team structure and architecture influence each other?
8. How do you evaluate architectural debt?
9. How do you document architecture decisions?
10. How do you modernize a legacy architecture?

## Example Answers / Key Points

- Start with a direct, role-relevant answer in one or two lines.
- Use concrete examples from projects, campaigns, deals, incidents, or launches.
- Quantify impact where possible (latency, conversion, win rate, revenue, retention, time saved).
- Mention tradeoffs and why your chosen approach fit the context.
- Close with a concise summary statement.

## Common Mistakes Candidates Make

- Giving abstract answers without context.
- Skipping constraints, assumptions, or risks.
- Answering only theory and not execution.
- Ignoring stakeholder impact (customers, team, business).
- Not providing measurable outcomes.

## Advanced Follow-up Questions

1. What would make you choose a different approach?
2. How would your answer change at 10x scale or in a regulated environment?
3. What metrics would you monitor post-implementation?
4. How would you explain this to a non-technical stakeholder?
5. What failure mode worries you most and why?

## Real-world Application

This question type appears in architecture reviews, sales strategy meetings, product planning, incident response, and leadership evaluations. Mastering it improves communication quality, decision speed, and delivery reliability.

## Recommended Answer Framework (Applied)

Use the 5-step comparison model:
1. Decision criteria
2. Option A pros/cons
3. Option B pros/cons
4. Recommendation for this context
5. Risks and reversal trigger

## Question-by-Question Application

- For Question 1-3: define criteria before evaluating options.
- For Question 4-7: compare alternatives by cost, risk, and maintainability.
- For Question 8-10: conclude with context-specific recommendation.
