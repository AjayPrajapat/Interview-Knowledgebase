# Schema Design

## Overview

Schema design questions test ability to model business entities and future-proof data evolution.

## Skills Evaluated

- Concept clarity and structured thinking
- Practical decision-making under constraints
- Communication quality for technical and business audiences
- Risk awareness and mitigation planning
- Measurable outcome orientation

## Typical Interview Questions

1. How do you identify core entities and relations?
2. How do you model one-to-many and many-to-many relationships?
3. How do you design schema for analytics and transactions?
4. How do you support schema evolution safely?
5. How do you design multi-tenant schemas?
6. How do you enforce integrity constraints?
7. How do you model audit trails?
8. How do you handle soft deletes and lifecycle states?
9. How do you choose partition keys?
10. How do you plan migration from legacy schema?

## Example Answers / Key Points

- Start with a direct, role-relevant answer in one or two lines.
- Use concrete examples from projects, campaigns, deals, incidents, or launches.
- Quantify impact where possible (latency, conversion, win rate, revenue, retention, time saved).
- Mention tradeoffs and why your chosen approach fit the context.
- Close with a concise summary statement.

## Common Mistakes Candidates Make

- Giving abstract answers without context.
- Skipping constraints, assumptions, or risks.
- Answering only theory and not execution.
- Ignoring stakeholder impact (customers, team, business).
- Not providing measurable outcomes.

## Advanced Follow-up Questions

1. What would make you choose a different approach?
2. How would your answer change at 10x scale or in a regulated environment?
3. What metrics would you monitor post-implementation?
4. How would you explain this to a non-technical stakeholder?
5. What failure mode worries you most and why?

## Real-world Application

This question type appears in architecture reviews, sales strategy meetings, product planning, incident response, and leadership evaluations. Mastering it improves communication quality, decision speed, and delivery reliability.

## Recommended Answer Framework (Applied)

Use the 6-step model:
1. Clarify requirements and constraints
2. High-level approach
3. Step-by-step implementation
4. Risks and edge cases
5. Validation (tests/metrics/monitoring)
6. Summary with tradeoff statement

## Question-by-Question Application

- For Question 1-3: start with assumptions and system boundaries.
- For Question 4-7: provide phased implementation with dependencies.
- For Question 8-10: explain validation, rollout, and rollback plans.
