# Performance

## Overview

Performance questions evaluate bottleneck identification and impact-driven optimization decisions.

## Skills Evaluated

- Concept clarity and structured thinking
- Practical decision-making under constraints
- Communication quality for technical and business audiences
- Risk awareness and mitigation planning
- Measurable outcome orientation

## Typical Interview Questions

1. How do you profile a slow endpoint?
2. How do you improve frontend load performance?
3. How do you tune backend throughput?
4. How do you choose performance budgets?
5. How do you reduce latency variance?
6. How do you avoid premature optimization?
7. How do you measure p95 and p99 improvements?
8. How do you optimize I/O-heavy operations?
9. How do you validate performance changes safely?
10. How do you communicate performance tradeoffs?

## Example Answers / Key Points

- Start with a direct, role-relevant answer in one or two lines.
- Use concrete examples from projects, campaigns, deals, incidents, or launches.
- Quantify impact where possible (latency, conversion, win rate, revenue, retention, time saved).
- Mention tradeoffs and why your chosen approach fit the context.
- Close with a concise summary statement.

## Common Mistakes Candidates Make

- Giving abstract answers without context.
- Skipping constraints, assumptions, or risks.
- Answering only theory and not execution.
- Ignoring stakeholder impact (customers, team, business).
- Not providing measurable outcomes.

## Advanced Follow-up Questions

1. What would make you choose a different approach?
2. How would your answer change at 10x scale or in a regulated environment?
3. What metrics would you monitor post-implementation?
4. How would you explain this to a non-technical stakeholder?
5. What failure mode worries you most and why?

## Real-world Application

This question type appears in architecture reviews, sales strategy meetings, product planning, incident response, and leadership evaluations. Mastering it improves communication quality, decision speed, and delivery reliability.

## Recommended Answer Framework (Applied)

Use the 6-step diagnostic model:
1. Scope and reproduce
2. Collect evidence
3. Form hypotheses
4. Confirm root cause
5. Fix + rollback strategy
6. Prevent recurrence

## Question-by-Question Application

- For Question 1-3: show how you isolate symptoms from causes.
- For Question 4-7: explain evidence collection and hypothesis testing.
- For Question 8-10: end with prevention controls and monitoring.
